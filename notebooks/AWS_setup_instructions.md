##Part 1: Create an AWS account

Go to [http://aws.amazon.com/](http://aws.amazon.com/) and sign up: 

- You may sign in using your existing Amazon account or you can create a new account by selecting
  **Create a free account** using the button at the right, then selecting **I am a new user**.
  
- Enter your contact information and confirm your acceptance of the AWS Customer Agreement.

- Once you have created an Amazon Web Services Account, you may need to accept a telephone call to
  verify your identity. Some people have used Google Voice successfully if you don't have or don't
  want to give a mobile number.
  
- Once you have an account, go to [http://aws.amazon.com/](http://aws.amazon.com/) and sign in. You
  will work primarily from the Amazon Management Console.

- Create Security Credentials.  Go to the 
  [AWS security credentials page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential).
  If you are asked about IAM users, close the message.  Expand **Access Keys** and click **Create New
  Access Key**.  You will see a message **Your access key (access key ID and secret access key) has been
  created successfully**. Click **Download Key File** and save it to your home directory. 
  
  Remember where this file is. It contains the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**.

- Download and save the `.pem` private key file to a new folder `.ssh` in your home directory. Any folder
  that starts with a `.` will hide the folder. In this case, you want to hide the sensitive information.
  Change the permissions of the file using this command:

  ```$ chmod 600 </path/to/saved/keypair/file.pem>```
