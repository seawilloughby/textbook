    "#Community Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "#####PowerLaw:\n",
    " - The probability of a node being degree K = degree of node ^ gamma\n",
    " - the point is that it is more likley that a new node is connected to a highly central node than an outlier\n",
    " \n",
    "###Types of Graphs:\n",
    " - Undirected (all connections equal- like facebook)\n",
    " - Directed - connections can be one way- like twitter\n",
    " - Bipartite - may have mutliple edges from one node\n",
    " - Weighted - some edges may have more weight than others\n",
    " \n",
    "###Connected Components:\n",
    "A subgraph where any two certices are connected to eacother by an edge\n",
    " #####Strongly Connected Component:\n",
    " Subgraph where every node is reachable by another node\n",
    " \n",
    "###Data Structure\n",
    "Two main types\n",
    " - Adjacency Matrix\n",
    "     - take up more space if sparce but faster\n",
    " - Adjacenty List\n",
    "     - takes up less space, slower to look up \n",
    "     \n",
    "##Centrality\n",
    " - important node is connected to a large number of other nodes. \n",
    " - noramlize by dividing the total number of nodes - 1\n",
    " \n",
    " 1) Degree Centrality:\n",
    "     may not capture most 'important nodes' if between two networks\n",
    " \n",
    " 2) Betweenness Cenrality:\n",
    "     an important node controls the passage from one node to another\n",
    " \n",
    " 3) Eigenvector Centrality:\n",
    "      important nodes\n",
    "          - have important neighbors\n",
    "          - are connected to nodes with high degrees\n",
    "          - may not have a high degree themselves\n",
    "       \n",
    "###Graph Traversal:\n",
    " - in order to perform graph related operations, must systematically visit AL Lthe notes\n",
    " - MOST POPULAR: BREATH FIRST SEARCH\n",
    " \n",
    " ```\n",
    " Visit all the neighbors of a node\n",
    " Then vist all the neighbors of the neighbors\n",
    " Then find the shortest Path\n",
    " ```"

    " - equals the density of edges within a subgraph - the baseline edge density of the same subgraph randomized \n",
    " - High Modularity: A 'better' community\n",
    "###2. Node Similarity\n",
    " - the number of neighbors 2 nodes share\n",

    "    - recalculate betweeness \n",
    "    - calculate modularity if new commuities are formed\n",

    "###2. Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative Algorithm)\n",
    "    - start with every node as a community\n",
    "    - merge based on max similarity / min distance between elements of the 2 clusters\n",
    "    - have to decide a cut off\n",
    "    - hierarchy is by construction, so it's not always sensible\n",
    "    - best for network sthat are heiarchical"
